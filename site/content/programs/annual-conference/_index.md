<span class="lead-in">In 2020, NNPN will host its first virtual Annual Conference.</span>


Additionally, this is the first time that NNPN will introduce its annual Summit, which we envision as a time for NNPNâ€™s constituencies and friends across the field to come together to contemplate the big questions impacting our work as a whole.

This year, we ask the question: **How can theaters become essential to their communities?**

We will convene Tuesday, May 26 - Friday, May 29. See below for our schedule and registration links - COMING SOON!
