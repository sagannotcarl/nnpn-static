<span class=lead-in>As patrons return to the theater, how can we Grow Forward to meet them?</span>

The American theater's audiences are made of full humans. More than “butts in seats” and names on a donor page, how can our relationships with our communities be deepened and made truly mutually beneficial? How can audiences become invested co-creators in our missions, visions, and values?

How can we transform transactional relationships into vibrant partnerships as we grow forward toward a more equitable, robust, and responsive American theater?

National New Play Network's 2021 Annual Conference aims to explore these questions, provoke still others, and share the expertise, curiosity, and dream building occurring within and just adjacent to our community of new play makers and lovers nationwide.

We kicked off the Conference on June 11 with a:

Sessions for our June 12th conference day included:

### OPENING PLENARY: Decolonizing Theater's Relationship with Audiences ###
What do non-extractive, anti-racist, and interdependent relationships with audience, community, and the land look like?

### BREAKOUT SESSIONS ###
**New Work Development as Audience Relationship Development** <br>
How can inviting audiences to be part of the new work process deepen our relationships with them?
 
**Language & Messaging Specific to Communities of Interest** <br>
What we say is important - but so is how we say it. How can we adjust our message to best connect with the intended recipients?
 
**Symbiotic Community Partnerships** <br>
How can partnerships between theaters and other social sector organizations create a solid foundation for shared progress?

**Digital Engagement for Accessibility, Reach, & Relationships** <br>
How can innovations created or deepened during the past year lead to greater engagement with existing and new audiences?
 
**Centering the Audience During Leadership Change** <br>
Leadership shifts can be important times for audience development. How can new leaders keep their audiences front of mind?

**Creating Buy-In of Mission Among Donors and Board** <br>
The Board of Directors has fiduciary oversight - but how can empowering them to "own" the mission increase investment and engagement?
 
### CLOSING PLENARY: Repositioning Theaters as Community Service Organizations ###
What does it look like to reimagine how an arts institution defines, listens to, and creates work by, for, about, and with its audiences?
