<span class="lead-in">In 2020, NNPN will host its first virtual Annual Conference.</span>


Additionally, this is the first time that NNPN will introduce its annual Summit, which we envision as a time for NNPN’s constituencies and partners across the field to come together to contemplate the big questions impacting our work as a whole.

This year, we ask the question: **How can theaters become essential to their communities?**

We will convene Tuesday, May 26 - Friday, May 29. See below for our schedule and registration links - COMING SOON! Please note that while all sessions are free, registration is required (except for the Happy Hour).

## May 26
### 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT | We've Been Here Before: Theater & Crisis
**Best For: Anyone & Everyone!**\
Registration Link Coming Soon!

Theater is no stranger to calamity. From the plagues that devastated Sophocles’s Athens, Shakespeare’s London, and Kushner’s NYC, to the acts of war and economic devastation that upended the whole world at once – the theater has survived, evolved, and thrived through it all. With perspectives from across history, a crack panel of dramaturgs illuminate where we’ve been as an art form – and invite us to consider where we hope to go next. This panel and discussion features Carrie Kaplan, Tanya Palmer, Sally Ollove, Edwin Wong, and moderator Julie Felise Dubiner.

### 4:30pm EDT / 1:30pm PDT | Pitch Session!
**Best For: Member Theater representatives**\

The classic NNPN session goes digital! In addition to sharing the new plays and Rolling World Premiere opportunities that we are excited about producing in the future, we will also swap ideas about digital and analog strategies for engaging audiences and artists in the interim.


### 7pm EDT / 4pm PDT | A Virtual New Play Reading of **DIARY OF AN EROTIC LIFE**

*Lulu, a young and ambitious South American woman, graduates from DePaul University, debt free thanks to her investor, Gold Coast native, Caroline. Lulu will not feel the vulnerability ofher immigration status as long as she does not veer from “their plan”. When romance complicates their arrangement, so does race, class, and power. Will Lulu ever find her American dream or will her spirit be crushed by her capitalism-entrenched community? A desecration of Wedekind's Lulu plays, reimagined in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood in 2019.*

### 3pm EDT | Triple Play: Past, Present, Future
**Best For: Audience Engagement & Marketing Pros**\
[Click here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZAldO6rpjgjHtQCzcrRZ-he6_Hdnc8B16cT) to register\
Triple Play is a national research project created by Theatre Development Fund and Theatre Bay Area, with support from NNPN Member Theaters, that investigated the relationship of audiences to new plays. In this session, Victoria Bailey (TDF) and Brad Erickson (TBD) will lead us through a continued investigation of how findings from the initial study were impacting audience development efforts pre-pandemic as well as how we might build upon this work going forward to find and build new audiences, turn our occasional ticket-buyers into new works advocates, and hone our skills for bringing our aspirational audiences into our spaces when we reopen.

**How to Prepare:** Session participants should be familiar with Triple Play, either through past experience and/or by reading the Executive Summary of the full report (available here).


### 4:30pm EDT / 1:30pm PDT | Social Impact Commons: Reimagining Our Sector: Possible Futures for Your Resource (aka “Business”) Model
**Best For: Artistic & Business Leaders**\
[Click here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYvcOqvrj0oGdN65dUFcjr94HqfT9RVDBhT) to register\
This session, presented by Thaddeus Squire and Asta Petkeviciute of Social Impact Commons, focuses on how the rapidly changing landscape, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, is inspiring new thinking in how we gather the resources to do our work. While money is certainly a focus, we will be thinking about resources (or “business model”) more expansively, examining how our approach to organizing personnel, technology, and even audiences themselves may be shifting and what this means for your work moving forward. This session is for both artistic and management team members of theatres. Ideally you should have done some scenario thinking about how the COVID-19 crisis is and will be affecting your work and what you might do to pivot. There is a short (30 min) preparatory exercise to gather some thinking about future scenarios that we ask participants to complete beforehand.

### 6:30pm EDT / 3:30pm PDT | NNPN Virtual Happy Hour
**Best For: Anyone & Everyone!**\
Because the Networking part of the Network is what makes the Network work! Grab your beverage (and snack) of choice and join this casual hang-out to meet new colleagues, catch up with old friends, and schmooze.\

### 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT | JCA Arts Marketing: Valuing Art in the Era of COVID-19
**Best For: Managing & Marketing Pros**\
[Click here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcsc-yurjkuGt3eOC2TtaQSCi8AJ5D2lpDn) to register\
During the time of coronavirus, theatres are not short on plans for online content (for the short-term) and for eventually reopening their doors (for the long-term). A critical piece of these plans is the price of a ticket, which is key to determine both your revenue and your audience’s perception of your art.

In this session, experts Jennifer Sowinski and Jamie Alexander from JCA Arts Marketing will explore how to communicate value and maximize revenue through pricing for online and in-person performances. We’ll review questions such as: How do you price streamed performances and other online offerings, and how do you communicate their value to patrons? How much will audiences be willing to pay for a theatre ticket after reopening? How can you make up lost revenue through pricing?

You’ll come away with basic knowledge of pricing best practices for online and offline content, and ideas for optimizing revenue and value perception through pricing.   

### 4pm EDT / 1pm PDT | POC Affinity Space

This session will provide an affinity space for white theater-makers eager to work toward racial justice and equity in the American theater (and the world writ large). This space will allow us to ask tough questions, share experiences and support, and work together to envision what might come next for ourselves and our field as we begin to imagine an anti-racist, post-pandemic world. 

### 7pm EDT / 4pm PDT | A Virtual New Play Reading of **THE LOYALS**\
by NNPN Affiliated Artist Alison Gregory\
directed by Hayley Finn\
presented by our friends at [The Playwrights Center](https://pwcenter.org/)\
Registration Link Coming Soon!\
*Meet Peggy Shipman: young, bright, socially prominent, politically ambivalent.\
At eighteen she becomes Mrs. Benedict Arnold. But wait -- is she a knowing partner in her infamous husband’s treason? Is she playing a conniving role in his outrageous attempt to destroy a adolescent country fighting for its independence? Or is she merely a naïve spouse, betrayed along with George Washington and the rest of America? And how does she get her hair so high?
The Loyals is a gripping investigation into espionage and patriotism during the American Revolution – and the greatest act of disloyalty this young country had ever seen. History is the fundamental lens through which we view the present. With this romantic comedy about treason, I seek to investigate the intersection of historical fact and my own narrative invention, while telling a two-hundred and forty year-old narrative that throws light and resonance on today’s political shenanigans.*

In an era when safety, security, and risk are both individually-defined and at the front of audiences’ minds, how can new play theaters across the country effectively and cohesively communicate the policies and procedures they’ve implemented to ensure the well-being of in-person visitors to their spaces? This session will start to develop ideas for a national campaign that champions safety and compassionately encourages audiences to come back to the theater.
