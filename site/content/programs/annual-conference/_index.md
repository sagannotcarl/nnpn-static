<span class="lead-in">In 2020, NNPN will host its first virtual Annual Conference.</span>


Additionally, this is the first time that NNPN will introduce its annual Summit, which we envision as a time for NNPN’s constituencies and partners across the field to come together to contemplate the big questions impacting our work as a whole.

This year, we ask the question: **How can theaters become essential to their communities?**

We will convene Tuesday, May 26 - Friday, May 29. See below for our schedule and registration links. Please note that while all sessions are free, registration is required (except for the Happy Hour).

## May 26
### 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT | We've Been Here Before: Theater & Crisis
**Best For: Anyone & Everyone!**\
Theater is no stranger to calamity. From the plagues that devastated Sophocles’s Athens, Shakespeare’s London, and Kushner’s NYC, to the acts of war and economic devastation that upended the whole world at once – the theater has survived, evolved, and thrived through it all. With perspectives from across history, a crack panel of dramaturgs illuminate where we’ve been as an art form – and invite us to consider where we hope to go next. This panel and discussion features Carrie Kaplan, Tanya Palmer, Sally Ollove, Edwin Wong, and moderator Julie Felise Dubiner.

*Lulu, a young and ambitious South American woman, graduates from DePaul University, debt free thanks to her investor, Gold Coast native, Caroline. Lulu will not feel the vulnerability ofher immigration status as long as she does not veer from “their plan”. When romance complicates their arrangement, so does race, class, and power. Will Lulu ever find her American dream or will her spirit be crushed by her capitalism-entrenched community? A desecration of Wedekind's "Lulu" plays, reimagined in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood in 2019.*

## May 27
### 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT | Triple Play: Past, Present, Future
**Best For: NNPN Member Theater Audience Engagement & Marketing Pros (please note space is limited for this session)**\
This session will engage participants in participatory conversation about the new take-aways from the Triple Play study uncovered by NNPN Member Theaters and others in the new play sector. Led by Triple Play partners **Tory Bailey** of [Theatre Development Fund](https://www.tdf.org/) and **Brad Erickson** of [Theatre Bay Area](https://www.theatrebayarea.org/), the discussion will ask: 

What learning from Triple Play informed your audience engagement effort practices pre-COVID and what efforts were most effective in attracting new audiences and converting occasional theater-goers into new works fans? 

What learning from Triple Play is informing your practices now in the midst of the pandemic? 

What learning do you imagine bringing forward into your practices as we emerge from the pandemic and how might they assist you in attracting new audiences and deepening engagement once we have reopened our theaters? 

In considering these questions, we hope to generate ideas about the audience we imagine for the future-how do we ensure the continued engagement of our traditional audiences, how do we build on engagement with new participants we may be reaching right now as we use technology to reduce barriers and who are the newcomers in the future audience we might want to reach when we reopen our doors?

**How to Prepare:** Session participants should be familiar with Triple Play, either through past experience and/or by reading the Executive Summary of the full report (available [here](https://www.tdf.org/cmsfiles/documents/TriplePlayExecutiveSummary.pdf)).

### 4:30pm EDT / 1:30pm PDT | Social Impact Commons: Reimagining Our Sector: Possible Futures for Your Resource (aka “Business”) Model
**Best For: NNPN Member Theater Artistic & Management Leaders (please note space is limited for this session)**\
This session, presented by **Thaddeus Squire** and **Asta Petkeviciute** of [Social Impact Commons](https://www.socialimpactcommons.org/), focuses on how the rapidly changing landscape, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, is inspiring new thinking in how we gather the resources to do our work. While money is certainly a focus, we will be thinking about resources (or “business model”) more expansively, examining how our approach to organizing personnel, technology, and even audiences themselves may be shifting and what this means for your work moving forward. This session is for both artistic and management team members of theatres. Ideally you should have done some scenario thinking about how the COVID-19 crisis is and will be affecting your work and what you might do to pivot. There is a short (30 min) [preparatory exercise](https://nationalnewplaynetwork013-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/admin_nnpn_org/EUdDZETVaJtIiVWwzLlhPtIBZbCdUbDe9gvANb3AjBROPA?e=AgpSip) to gather some thinking about future scenarios that we ask participants to complete beforehand.

### 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT | JCA Arts Marketing: Valuing Art in the Era of COVID-19
**Best For: Managing & Marketing Pros**\
During the time of coronavirus, theatres are not short on plans for online content (for the short-term) and for eventually reopening their doors (for the long-term). A critical piece of these plans is the price of a ticket, which is key to determine both your revenue and your audience’s perception of your art.

In this session, experts **Jennifer Sowinski** and **Jamie Alexander** from [JCA Arts Marketing](https://jcainc.com/) will explore how to communicate value and maximize revenue through pricing for online and in-person performances. We’ll review questions such as: How do you price streamed performances and other online offerings, and how do you communicate their value to patrons? How much will audiences be willing to pay for a theatre ticket after reopening? How can you make up lost revenue through pricing?

You’ll come away with basic knowledge of pricing best practices for online and offline content, and ideas for optimizing revenue and value perception through pricing.

### 4pm EDT / 1pm PDT | POC Affinity Space
**Designed For: POC Folx in the NNPN Community (includes Affiliated Artists, and Ambassadors)**\

### 4pm EDT / 1pm PDT | Anti-Racist Affinity Space for White Folks
**Designed For: White Folx in the NNPN Community (includes Affiliated Artists, Ambassadors, and Partner Organizations)**\
This session will provide an affinity space for white theater-makers eager to work toward racial justice and equity in the American theater (and the world writ large). This space will allow us to ask tough questions, share experiences and support, and work together to envision what might come next for ourselves and our field as we begin to imagine an anti-racist, post-pandemic world.

### 7pm EDT / 4pm PDT | A Virtual New Play Reading of **THE LOYALS**
**Best For: Anyone & Everyone! (please note that tickets are limited to this event)**\
by NNPN Affiliated Artist [Alison Gregory](https://newplayexchange.org/users/1848/allison-gregory)\
directed by Hayley Finn\
presented by our friends at [The Playwrights Center](https://pwcenter.org/)

*Meet Peggy Shipman: young, bright, socially prominent, politically ambivalent. At eighteen she becomes Mrs. Benedict Arnold. But wait -- is she a knowing partner in her infamous husband’s treason? Is she playing a conniving role in his outrageous attempt to destroy an adolescent country fighting for its independence? Or is she merely a naïve spouse, betrayed along with George Washington and the rest of America? And how does she get her hair so high?*

The Loyals *is a gripping investigation into espionage and patriotism during the American Revolution – and the greatest act of disloyalty this young country had ever seen. History is the fundamental lens through which we view the present. With this romantic comedy about treason, Gregory seeks to investigate the intersection of historical fact and her own narrative invention, while telling a two-hundred and forty year-old narrative that throws light and resonance on today’s political shenanigans.*

### 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT | Imagining a "Back to the Theater" campaign
**Best For: Artistic, Managing, & Marketing Leaders**\
In an era when safety, security, and risk are both individually-defined and at the front of audiences’ minds, how can new play theaters across the country effectively and cohesively communicate the policies and procedures they’ve implemented to ensure the well-being of in-person visitors to their spaces? This session will start to develop ideas for a national campaign that champions safety and compassionately encourages audiences to come back to the theater.

### 4pm EDT / 1pm PDT | You Have Everything You Need: Expanding the Depth, Breadth, and Diversity of your Audience
**Best For: Anyone & Everyone!**\
While we must wait until our 2021 Conference to join our friends at the [Phoenix Theatre](https://www.phoenixtheatre.org/) in Indianapolis, there is much to be explored in the work taking place across the city’s arts & cultural sector, particularly as it relates to audience engagement, development, and inclusion. This session will feature a conversation among **Tamara Winfrey-Harris**, Vice President of Community Leadership and Effective Philanthropy at [Central Indiana Community Foundation](https://www.cicf.org/); **Joanna Beatty Taft**, Executive Director of the [Harrison Center](https://www.harrisoncenter.org/); and **Dr. Charles L. Venable**, The Melvin & Bren Simon Director and CEO of [Newfields](https://discovernewfields.org/), home to the Indianapolis Museum of Art, The Garden, and the Virginia B. Fairbanks Art & Nature Park.  

Each speaker will offer insights into how they leveraged the existing assets of their respective institutions to create value and access for a larger and more diverse segment of their community. Panelists will consider how strategies employed in the visual arts sector can be applied to the theater field, particularly as we strive to spotlight new stories and voices. How might we expand the purpose and utility of our physical spaces, work with artists to address the alienating and divisive forces of cultural gentrification in our surrounding neighborhoods, and reconsider how (and why) we invite diverse artists and audiences into primarily white institutions? And how might this work help our theaters become essential to their communities?
