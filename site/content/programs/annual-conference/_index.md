<span class="lead-in">In 2020, NNPN will host its first virtual Annual Conference.</span>


Additionally, this is the first time that NNPN will introduce its annual Summit, which we envision as a time for NNPN’s constituencies and friends across the field to come together to contemplate the big questions impacting our work as a whole.

This year, we ask the question: **How can theaters become essential to their communities?**
