<span class="lead-in">NNPN STRIVES TO PIONEER, IMPLEMENT, AND DISSEMINATE PROGRAMS THAT REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY THEATERS COLLABORATE TO SUPPORT NEW PLAYS AND PLAYWRIGHTS.</span>

Our programs are designed to support new play makers on both the organizational and individual level, with opportunities for growth and exposure, and efforts to create an environment that enables the best possible work to be made, shared, and enjoyed.

We aim to be responsive to the issues around us so that we can best advance and sustain our [Core and Associate Members](/member-theaters), [Affiliated Artists](/affiliated-artists), and the national new play sector as a whole.
