Kit Yan and Melissa Li, together with Company One Theatre and the Pao Arts Center/Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, are creating the Chinatown Project â€” an original song cycle that uplifts and amplifies the unique narratives of Boston's Chinatown community. Their two-year residency will culminate in an outdoor event at the Chinatown Gate in late summer 2021 (should public health concerns allow it), and/or in a digital space.
