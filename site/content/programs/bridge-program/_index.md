### Context & Structure ###
While our theaters rebuild the capacity to participate in traditional Rolling World Premieres, NNPN can leverage the financial resources already set aside for that program in its FY21 budget to incentivize theaters to prioritize programming new work by BIPOC artists. Whether in development or production, work that is responsive to and in conversation with NNPN Member Theaters’ specific communities and the particular issues with which they are grappling,can move us closer to our goals of creating an anti-racist and anti-biased space for new plays.

The goals of the Bridge Program are two-fold:

* To incentivize NNPN Member Theaters to develop, produce, and extend the life of new plays by theater artists who are Black, Indigenous, and/or People of Color (BIPOC) in their re-imagined 2020-21/2021 seasons.
* To incentivize and support NNPN Member Theaters in developing and implementing anti-racist practices in their production of new plays by, for, about, and with BIPOC theater makers.

### Accountability to Anti-Racism ###
Audiences are recognized as a critical agent in any theatrical process;projects are required to have a public/presentation component.

The primary point person and generative artist(s)responsible for/associated with the project will become part of a cohort for collective accountability around participating in the Bridge Program.

Facilitated monthly chats will bring the cohort together so that they can provide mentorship, mutual support, and group accountability as they build best practices and navigate the artistic processes for their projects.Participation in these sessions are mandatory. Some sessions will be convened as separate BIPOC & White Anti-Racist Affinity spaces.The cohort will also have a dedicated area on MightyNetworks, NNPN’s member engagement platform,to share resources and continue the conversation between chats.

Through MightyNetworks, theaters agree to share their process and the best practices they establish during these artistic processes with NNPN staff and other NNPN Member Theaters.This will create a “library” of model practices for supporting BIPOC artists working on new plays in both TOCs and PWIs.
