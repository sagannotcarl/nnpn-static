Milagro (Portland, OR), Teatro Luna West (Los Angeles & Chicago), and UrbanTheater Company (Chicago, IL) will partner to develop and produce a series of virtual development intensives and a virtual live reading of *City Without Altar* by Jasminne Mendez (Houston, TX). This play will also serve as a launchpad for a focused and in-depth approach for dismantling anti-blackness in Latinx communities through theatre in our three cities.
