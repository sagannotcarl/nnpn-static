*KWEEN*, by Vichet Chum follows 16-year-old Soma, a Cambodian-American student at Lowell High School, who discovers her secret powers as a poet. Under the alias of the Khmer Kerouac, Soma’s new-found passion arises against the back drop of her father’s recent deportation, her mother’s journey to Cambodia to rectify the situation and her sister Dahvy’s upcoming wedding. The upcoming world premiere production at Merrimack Repertory Theatre is presented in partnership with Cambodian Mutual Assistance Association of Lowell.
