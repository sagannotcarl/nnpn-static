Marin Theatre Company’s originating co-production with Storykrapht of Denmo Ibrahim’s *Brilliant Mind* is a live and interactive digital experience with branching narratives inspired by true stories of first-generation Americans. Brilliant Mind is an excavation of the politics of gender in immigrant communities and the challenges ever present between tradition and culture, taking a hard look at generational trauma, the struggle between self and family, and the weight to carry a legacy.
