Through Diversionary Theatreâ€™s BIPOC Commissioning Program, Kenny Ramos will be developing a new play that centers two-spirit, Kumeyaay experiences in reservation and urban settings in southern California; and Farah Dinga will be developing a new play inspired by South West Asian mythology that mixes magic realism with the queer American experience.
