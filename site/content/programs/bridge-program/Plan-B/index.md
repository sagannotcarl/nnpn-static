The world premiere of LOCAL COLOR (June 3-13, 2021) streams as audio drama on Plan-B Theatre's website and app and is comprised of four short plays by first-time playwrights from our Theatre Artists of Color Writing Workshop: *DoLs* by Dee-Dee Darby-Duffin (a comedy about becoming fast friends in the most awkward situation imaginable); *Guise* by Chris Curlett (a dramedy about [re]defining masculinity); *Organic* by Tito Livas (a dark comedy about love, perception and Grindr); and *Suicide Box* by Tatiana Christian (an even darker comedy about the deadly side of customer service).
