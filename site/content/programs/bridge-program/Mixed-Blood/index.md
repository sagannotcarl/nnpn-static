play: "The Most Beautiful Home...Maybe"
---
*The Most Beautiful Homeâ€¦Maybe* by Mark Valdez, developed and produced at Mixed Blood Theatre, offers a nerdy and raucous vision for guaranteed housing. The multi-media performance juxtaposes housing data, Lyndon Johnson, and stories of Americans facing home insecurity, past and present. Offered as a two-part engagement and performance event, the project brings together key players in housing policy (advocates, tenant groups, developers, government workers, etc.) to envision a future where everyone has a home. There is a mounting need for solutions to our national housing crises. Can theater help solve these challenges?
