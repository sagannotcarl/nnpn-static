Theatre Exile will use the support of the Bridge Program to create and produce the world premiere of R. Eric Thomasâ€™s *The Ever Present*, an all-ages play that is resonant with and directly inspired by our South Philadelphia community, and designed to uplift and highlight the voices often unheard in our region.
