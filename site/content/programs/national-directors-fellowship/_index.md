<span class="lead-in">In conjunction with the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, The Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival, and the Stage Directors and Choreographers Foundation, NNPN began the National Directors Fellowship.</span>

The program is 18 months of hands-on, practical experience. It connects early-career directors to a vast network of new writers, expands access to professional support services, and provides laboratory-like environments for observation and experimentation, equipping tomorrow’s stage directors with the skills, knowledge, and network to advance new play development and production around the country.

Fellowships begin at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center in July, and include directing opportunities at the NNPN [MFA Playwrights' Workshop](/programs/mfa-playwrights-workshop/) (July), the [National Showcase of New Plays](/programs/national-showcase-of-new-plays/) (December), and the members-only Annual Conference (June), as well participation in the O'Neill Winter Symposium, finally culminating 12-18 months later with a Directing post or posts with National New Play Network Core Member Theaters.

Email [ndf@theoneill.org](mailto:ndf@theoneill.org) for additional information about the program and application.

Our current class of fellows was selected from a nationwide pool of more than 300 applicants, ranging broadly across all levels of experience and backgrounds. Read more about the 2017 Fellows here.
