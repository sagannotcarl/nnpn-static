<span class="lead-in">Established in 2002, the National Showcase of New Plays is an annual three-day event that showcases unproduced plays from across the country. The Showcase creates a unique and invaluable opportunity for production-ready new plays to be viewed by NNPN’s Core and Associate Members’ artistic directors and literary managers, as well as literary agents, publishers, and independent producers invited from around the country.</span>

Core and Associate [Member Theaters](http://nnpn.org/member-theaters/), Affiliated Artists from the [Playwright Residency/Collaboration Fund](http://nnpn.org/programs/collaboration-fund/) and [Rolling World Premiere](http://nnpn.org/programs/rolling-world-premieres/) programs, Showcase Finalists from the previous year, and selected [partner organizations](http://nnpn.org/about/partner-organizations/) submit scripts to be considered. The five plays presented as staged readings at the Showcase are selected by a panel of theater-makers from the Network's constituencies assembled by the Programs Director and Showcase Co-Chairs. NNPN Showcase readings are are cast and produced by the Core Member hosting the event, in partnership with the playwrights, submitting theaters as applicable, and NNPN staff.

Prospective Member Theaters, the [Ambassadors Council](http://nnpn.org/about/ambassadors-council/), [Affiliated Artists](http://nnpn.org/affiliated-artists/), and other industry professionals are invited to join our Core and Associate Members at the Showcase. More than 90% of the plays featured in Showcase have received a production within the next three seasons, many of them supported as NNPN Rolling World Premieres.
