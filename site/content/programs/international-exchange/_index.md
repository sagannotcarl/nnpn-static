<span class="lead-in">In 2012, NNPN began piloting the International Exchange, an initiative that emerged from the Networkâ€™s strong and growing interest in new play organizations and associations within other countries.</span>

The first international program was a playwright exchange with PlayWriting Australia, which brought two Australian playwrights and their plays to Washington, DC as part of the 2012 National Showcase. Two NNPN Alumni Playwrights then traveled to Perth to participate in their National Play Festival. We continue to explore possible future partnerships with PlayWriting Australia.

In 2013, NNPN began exploratory visits to Canada for the second international program. Representatives of the Canadian new play community attended the 2013 National Showcase in San Diego, and NNPN expects to announce the next international exchange soon.
