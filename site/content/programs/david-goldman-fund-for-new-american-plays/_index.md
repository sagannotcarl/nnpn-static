<span class="lead-in">Established in 2018, the David Goldman Fund for New American Plays was created to celebrate the continued legacy of NNPN's founder, David Goldman. The Fund supports the continued growth of NNPN's highly acclaimed Rolling World Premiere program. Each year, the Fund sponsors one Rolling World Premiere. Goldman himself selects the RWP each year to be given this recognition.</span>

In 2019, JUMP by Charly Evon Simpson was selected to be the inaugural recipient of the David Goldman Fund support. JUMP played at PlayMakers Repertory Company (North Carolina), then Portland, OR in a co-production between Milagro and Confrontation Theatre, and Austin, TX with Shrewd Productions, before concluding in Atlanta, GA at Actor's Express.
