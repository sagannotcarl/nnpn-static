<span class="lead-in">IN 2010, IN AN EFFORT TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATIVE, PIONEERING, PROJECT-BASED PARTNERSHIPS AMONG THEATERS IN SUPPORT OF PLAYWRIGHTS AND NEW PLAYS, NATIONAL NEW PLAY NETWORK ESTABLISHED ITS COLLABORATION FUND.</span>

The Collaboration Fund supports innovative partnerships that explore the many different ways theater companies can work, both together and with playwrights, on the development of a new work. Up to $10,000 per project is awarded annually on a competitive basis to projects proposed by NNPN Core Member Theaters.

**Theater-to-Theater Collaborations** encourage creative partnerships between Member Theaters that pilot new, unexpected projects, stepping outside their normal budgetary confines to work together to develop new plays.

**Theater-to-Playwright Collaborations** encourage creative partnerships between Member Theaters and playwrights that re-interpret traditional models of new work development, such as residencies, workshops, and festivals. Prior to 2016, Theater-to-Playwright Collaborations operated under the auspices of the **Playwrights-in-Residence** Program, which was established by NNPN in 2007.
