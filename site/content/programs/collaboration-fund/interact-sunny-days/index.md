**InterAct Theatre Company** and **The VORTEX** will collaborate on two virtual workshops in support of the development of [Reina Hardy](https://newplayexchange.org/users/223/reina-hardy)â€™s *Sunny Days*, which follows a fictionalized version of "Sesame Street" called "ABC City" through three points in time: 2004 Kosovo, a current day Immigrant Detention Center outside of Austin, TX, and the future envisioned just inland of a submerged Philadelphia.
