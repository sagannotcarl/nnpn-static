## National New Play Network's Anti-Racism and Anti-Bias Vision Statement

For over 20 years, National New Play Network has incubated and elevated ne work by creating community, fostering collaboration, and standing firm in our unshakable belief that everything is better when we all work together. 

Two years ago, we strengthened our commitment to new work and to each other by dedicating our next five years to making NNPN and the new play field more equitable, diverse, and inclusive. 

We are working to widen the lens of who makes, shares, and experiences the stories we craft, centering and amplifying theater-makers of color and other artists and audiences who have historically been overlooked and ignored. 

We have committed to anti-racist and anti-bias practices and will be releasing our detailed plan in early 2021. We are proud to lead this charge with great joy, renewed purpose, and new-found hope for the future of our country and our field.
