<p><span class="lead-in">National New Play Network, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that collaborate in innovative ways to develop, produce, and extend the life of new plays, begins our new fiscal year with new staff, new roles, new Board Members, and gratitude for the work of past team members who have brought us to this moment.

Following the Nominating Committee's recommendation, the Core Membership of NNPN voted unanimously to welcome Clare Drobot and Leslie Ishii to the Board of Directors at their semi-annual meeting in May 2021. Leslie and Clare bring a wealth of experience, passion, and knowledge to the Board, and we are grateful to both of them for serving the Network in this new capacity. 

Simultaneously, NNPN offers our profound gratitude to Raymond Bobgan (he/they) whose Board service ended June 30. In addition to serving as Board President, Raymond was co-chair of the Strategic Planning Committee whose work resulted in the creation of a new governance structure for NNPN and refocused our work through an anti-racist lens.

The Board of Directors is now 20 members strong, 50% of whom are of the global majority; 80% are women. This means that NNPN has met its strategic goals for the demographic composition of our Board of Directors three years ahead of schedule.
