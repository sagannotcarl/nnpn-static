<p><span class="lead-in">National New Play Network, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that collaborate in innovative ways to develop, produce, and extend the life of new plays, envisions a robust, equitable new play ecology. This vision guides every facet of the Network's work, including the Anti-Racism and Anti-Bias Plan & Commitment to Action that its Board of Directors has drafted, revised, and ratified.</p>

"As our industry looks to rebuild from COVID-19 and reform in light of the heightened call for racial justice, I am honored to be a part of NNPN, an organization committed to charting a new way forward that celebrates, empowers, and uplifts the diversity of our voices," said NNPN Ambassador and Board Member Reginald L. Douglas. "Together, we are working to create a new play ecology that is rooted in equity and hope, abandoning the past and its status quo of exclusion in joyful favor of an industry that thrives on inclusion."

"The Member Theaters, Affiliated Artists, and Ambassadors of NNPN believe in the power collaboration infuses into transformation," said Nan Barnett, NNPN's Executive Director. "We are grateful for the Board of Directors' leadership and eager for the work ahead, which we feel confident will bring us closer to the equitable and inclusive American theater we envision."
