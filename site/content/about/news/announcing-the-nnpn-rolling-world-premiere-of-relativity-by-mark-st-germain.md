<p><span class="lead-in"><strong>Washington, D.C.</strong> - <strong>The </strong><a href="http://www.nnpn.org/" rel="nofollow"><strong>National New Play Network</strong></a><strong>, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that champions the development, production, and continued life of new plays, announces the 59th NNPN Rolling World Premiere (RWP) of </strong><a href="https://newplayexchange.org/plays/47088/relativity" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>Relativity</em></strong></a><strong> by </strong><a href="https://newplayexchange.org/users/5493/mark-st-germain" rel="nofollow"><strong>Mark St. Germain</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The Roll includes NNPN Core Members <a href="https://www.floridastudiotheatre.org/relativity" rel="nofollow">Florida Studio Theatre</a> (Sarasota, FL, June 24-July 2), who originally commissioned the play, and <a href="https://www.riversidetheatre.org/" rel="nofollow">Riverside Theatre</a> (Iowa City, IA, March 31-April 15, 2017), as well as Associate Members <a href="http://taproottheatre.org/" rel="nofollow">Taproot Theatre Company</a> (Seattle, WA, March 26-April 29, 2017) and <a href="http://www.northlight.org/pages/2016_2017_season/404.php" rel="nofollow">Northlight Theatre</a> (Skokie, IL,  May 11-June 18, 2017).</span></p>
<p>NNPN provides production support to the playwright and the partnering theaters, including assistance with the creation and the contracting of the premiere agreement, collaborative interactions between the theaters, and funds for the playwright's residency in each city to further develop the play.</p>
<p>Florida Studio Theatre’s Associate Artist, Jason Cannon, who will also direct their lead production in the RWP of <em>Relativity</em>, says, “The RWP program addresses the biggest obstacle new plays face:  landing productions after the world premiere. By expanding and sharing the cache that comes with the label “world premiere,” new plays are given significantly more time and support to reach an audience, polish rough edges, and grab the interest of other potential producers. This program makes it far less likely that a play will simply submerge after that world premiere, that it can indeed have an on-going life!”</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT </strong><strong><em>RELATIVITY</em></strong></p>
<p>In 1949, a young Albert Einstein had a child with his future wife, Mileva. After 1951 their daughter Lieserl was never heard of again. Years later, in residence at Princeton University, Einstein is visited by a Reporter determined to solve that mystery. What follows is the struggle between a man desperate to conceal the truth and a woman who has her own secrets. <em>Relativity </em>is a journey through one of the greatest minds in history as two adversaries grapple with the meaning of Family, Love and the Question, “Does a Great Man have to be a Good Man?”</p>
