<h4>**ABOUT *HOW TO USE A KNIFE***</h4>
In the chaotic hustle and bustle of a Wall Street restaurant kitchen, Chef George is trying to stay sober. In between yelling at a pair of trash-talking line cooks and a pot-smoking busboy, he befriends Steve, an East African immigrant who seems to be a humble yet dignified dishwasher. Set during busy dinner shifts and filled with a cast of unforgettable New York characters, *How to Use a Knife* bursts with grinding suspense, energy, and surprise. Snider first developed *How to Use a Knife *at MCC Theater through the PlayLabs program, as well as the 2015 <a href="http://nnpn.org/programs/mfa-playwrights%E2%80%99-workshop" rel="nofollow">MFA Playwrights’ Workshop</a>, hosted each summer by the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival, NNPN, and Stanford University’s National Center for New Plays. It went on to a reading at the 2015 NNPN <a href="http://nnpn.org/programs/national-showcase-of-new-plays" rel="nofollow">National Showcase of New Plays</a> before securing commitments from four Member Theaters to make its Rolling World Premiere.

<h4>**ABOUT UNICORN THEATRE**</h4>
Founded in 1974, Unicorn Theatre enhances Kansas City by developing and producing professional, provocative new plays. Unicorn Theatre chooses plays, most of which are less than five years old, that have never been performed in Kansas City, or often anywhere at all. The Unicorn looks for plays about strong female characters, people of color, LGBT, and any marginalized group. Under the artistic and executive leadership of Producing Artistic Director Cynthia Levin, the theatre has produced more than 300 productions, with 20 percent of those being world premieres. “We believe that as theatre artists we should take responsibility for illuminating significant issues and initiating change,” Levin said. “Our hope is that every time you come to the Unicorn, you discover something about yourself you did not know before you walked in.” In the Midtown neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri, Unicorn Theatre houses two intimate stages — The Levin Stage (formerly The Main Stage) and The Jerome Stage (added in 2008). <a href="http://www.unicorntheatre.org/" rel="nofollow">unicorntheatre.org</a>
