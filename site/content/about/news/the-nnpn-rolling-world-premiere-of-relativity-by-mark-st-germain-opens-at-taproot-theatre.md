Critical acclaim for *Relativity*:

<blockquote>“*Relativity *is a tightly structured, information-packed 80 minutes, full of all the essential arguments, and…the actors, under the airtight direction of Northlight artistic director BJ Jones, bring total commitment to their portrayals.” –Hedy Weiss, *<a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/nature-nurture-and-relativity-drive-a-new-play-about-einstein/" rel="nofollow">Chicago Sun-Times</a>*

“The theater’s intimate setting is perfect for this glimpse into the private world of one of the greatest minds the world has known. It’s a play built on ‘what-ifs’ and ‘if onlys’ — those corrosive dramas that unfold in our minds during sleepless nights and can eat away at our souls… It’s a tour de force creation for both actors.” -Diana Nollen, *<a href="http://www.thegazette.com/subject/life/entertainment/arts/review/review-relativity-crackles-with-energy-mystery-20170414" rel="nofollow">The Gazette</a>*

“These are weighty issues for an 80-minute play without intermission, but St. Germain builds on them with both seriousness and a good amount of humor to make them relatable…” -Jay Handelman, *<a href="http://ticket.heraldtribune.com/2016/06/25/theater-review-engaging-relativity-at-fst/" rel="nofollow">Herald-Tribune</a>*

**ABOUT *****RELATIVITY***

In 1902, Albert Einstein's daughter was born. In 1904 she disappeared and Einstein never spoke nor wrote of her again. What happened? With playfulness and intensity, Relativity imagines one theory that bridges the Einsteins: the beloved public figure to the perplexing private man and the father to the lost child.
