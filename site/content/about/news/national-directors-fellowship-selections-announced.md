<h3>**ABOUT THE NATIONAL DIRECTORS FELLOWSHIP **</h3>
The Fellowship includes 18 months of practical, hands-on training, mentorship, and – most importantly – concludes with a professional directing opportunity. It connects directors to a vast network of playwrights and theaters, expands access to professional support services, and provides laboratory-like settings for observation and experimentation, equipping tomorrow’s stage directors with the skills, knowledge, and network to advance new play development and production around the country. Under the leadership of National Playwrights Conference Artistic Director Wendy C. Goldberg, Fellows begin in July of each year, observing and participating in the National Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center. Fellows then travel to the MFA Playwrights’ Workshop and Directing Intensive in August, led by NNPN and the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival, and the NNPN National Showcase of New Plays in December.  In January, they reconvene for an intense two-week Directing Symposium at the O’Neill, and the fellowship concludes with a professional directing opportunity at an NNPN Core Member theater. Funding for the National Directors Fellowship provided by <a href="http://www.ddcf.org/" rel="nofollow">Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.</a>
