<h3>**ABOUT THE 2016 MFA PLAYWRIGHTS’ WORKSHOP**</h3>
***Tight End***\
**By Rachel Bykowski, Ohio University**\
Directed by Tina Parker, Kitchen Dog Theater* (Dallas, TX)\
Dramaturgy by Adrien-Alice Hansel, Studio Theatre (Washington, DC)\
*Tight End* is the story of Ashley “Ash” Miller: a young woman in high school who is determined to join the football team. Ashley is throttled head first into a world dominated by rape culture where she must sacrifice her body to become one of guys on the football team.

***From Kings to Consuls***\
**By Tearrance Chisholm, Catholic University**\
Directed by Mark Routhier, NNPN Ambassador at Large\
Dramaturgy by Otis Ramsey Zoe, Howard University (Washington, D.C.)\
Lionel R. Hilderbrandt returns to the South Side of Chicago with a plan to marry Lacretia Bowser; he hopes to combine the power and prestige of their family names and take his rightful place as king of Chicago's black high society. But the once great kingdom has lost its former glory.  Set in the 1960s, this play is a loose retelling of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece*. It explores the dichotomy of the African American community, class relations, and what happens when the plans laid before us are not necessarily our own.

***Too Heavy for Your Pocket***\
**By Jiréh Breon Holder**\
Directed by LA Williams (New York, NY)\

Set in 1969, in a predominantly white suburb of Toronto, Canada, *Issei, He Say* explores the lives of the Chu family, a new Chinese immigrant family, as they move in next door to a Mr. Yamamoto, a Japanese Canadian man. As Mr. Yamamoto gets closer to each member of the Chu family, he helps them navigate the waters of assimilation while also forcing them to deal with their own prejudices.

***Right***\
**By Sam Lahne, University of Iowa**\
Directed by Jim Petosa, New Repertory Theatre* (Watertown, MA)\
Dramaturgy by Mark Bly, the Acting Company (New York, NY)\
*Right* is a darkly comedic drama that investigates nationality, loss of homeland, birthright, appropriation, self-determination by weaving together the Israeli/Palestinian and American Colonial/American Indian conflicts.

***Occupants***\
**By Mauricio Miranda, Indiana University**\
Directed by Cynthia Levin, Unicorn Theatre* (Kansas City, MO)\
Dramaturgy by Kelly Miller, the Kilroys (NNPN Ambassador at Large)\
This is the story of a South American woman, who immigrates to Hamilton Heights, Manhattan, escaping from the terror and the savage acts of the Shining Path movement in Peru’s Sierra back in the early 90‘s. Now, twenty years later, she has become a recluse, and her nineteen-year-old daughter Gabi, is trying to come to terms with her ambivalent identity in this new country she occupies.

***Franklin***\
**By Samantha Noble, Boston University**\
Directed by Gavin Witt, CENTERSTAGE* (Baltimore, MD)\
Dramaturgy by Kristen Leahey, Seattle Repertory Theatre (WA)\
The play juxtaposes the story of the 1845 Franklin Expedition of the Northwest Passage with that of a passionate young researcher determined to find the final resting place of its ships. On the last of her grant money, she faces her own struggle on the ice to track down the Erebus before she loses her chance forever. The members of her crew are rapidly losing faith, and her only female companion, a young musician, seems to be a money-grubbing detriment. But each woman might hold the key the other needs to discover the truth.
