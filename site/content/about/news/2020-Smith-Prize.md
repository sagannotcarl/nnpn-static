<p><span class="lead-in">National New Play Network, the country's alliance of professional theaters that collaborate in innovative ways to develop, produce, and extend the life of new plays, announces the winner of the 2020 Smith Prize for Political Theater: [Vickie Ramirez](https://newplayexchange.org/users/411/vickie-ramirez). </span></p>
<p>"The Smith Prize for Political Theater is a program that has been urgent and necessary since its inception," said NNPN Executive Director Nan Barnett. "The resonance and vision that Vickie's project will contribute to the American theater is especially vital at this time. We are thrilled to welcome her and her work into the Network.</p>

<p>Elisa Blandford, the Managing Producer of Native Voices at the Autry, the NNPN Member Theater that nominated Ramirez for the prize, said: "Vickie demands audience exploration of what it means not only to be American, but also to be human in a society that was ravaged by the atrocities of colonialization and the separation of Indigenous communities from mainstream culture. She poses challenging, political, and divisive questions â€“ questions with no one clear answer, allowing for continued audience dialogue when the play ends."</p>


<p>Ramirez is the 15th recipient of the Smith Prize for Political Theater, established in 2006 by Timothy Jay Smith and a group of socially conscious donors to encourage emerging playwrights to tackle the pressing issues of our times.</p>
