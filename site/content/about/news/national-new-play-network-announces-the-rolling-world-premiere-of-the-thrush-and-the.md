**ABOUT KITCHEN DOG THEATER**

It is the mission of <a href="http://kitchendogtheater.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kitchen Dog Theater</a> to provide a place where questions of justice, morality, and human freedom can be explored. We choose plays that challenge our moral and social consciences, invite our audiences to be provoked, challenged, and amazed. We believe that the theater is a site of individual discovery as well as a force against conventional views of the self and experience. It is not a provider of answers, but an invitation to question. Since theater of this kind is not bound by any tradition, Kitchen Dog Theater is committed to exploring these questions whether they are found in the classics, contemporary works, or new plays.

Our eclectic line-up of shows (and some might say artists) highlights the diversity of our community. While our productions have always had strong political and social commentary, we also love low-humor, high-humor, emotional drama, and realistic looks at life and art.
