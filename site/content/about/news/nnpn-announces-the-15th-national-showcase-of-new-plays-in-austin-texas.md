***Nomad Hotel***\
**By Carla Ching**\
Alix lives in a tiny motel room with her mother and two brothers, scrabbling to make weekly rent. Mason lives comfortably in a grand, empty house while his father runs jobs for the Hong Kong Triad. Until the day his father disappears and Mason has to figure out how to come up with grocery money and dodge Child Services and the INS. Mason and Alex develop an unlikely friendship, struggling to survive, and trying to outrun the mistakes of their parents. Will they make it out or fall through the cracks? A play about Motel Kids and Parachute Kids raising themselves and living at the poverty line in a land of plenty.\
\
***Br’er Cotton***\
**By Tearrance Arvelle Chisholm**\
Lynchburg, Virginia. The former site of a thriving cotton mill is now an impoverished neighborhood. Deeply affected by all the recent killings of young black men like himself, Ruffrino, a 14 year old “militant,” incites riots at school and online. More and more at odds with his mother and grandfather, the boy’s anger grows beyond containment while the family home literally sinks into the cotton field, and no one seems to notice but him. He’s out to save the world, wake up the zombies, and prove by any means necessary that Black Lives Matter.\
\
***The Mermaid Hour***\
**By David Valdes Greenwood**\
Working class parents try to navigate the gender transition of their daughter Vi as she rocks her first crush, discovers the power of YouTube, and decides they aren't moving fast enough.\
\
***Motherland***\
**By Allison Gregory**\
A self-made woman does her crafty best to protect her wayward children, keep her food truck business thriving, and impart some kind of moral code in an inner city battling collapse. But in the War on Poverty it turns out the enemy is hard to identify, and objectives are even murkier. In *Motherland* grit, guile, and guns are everyday parenting tools, and hope comes at a cost. A funny, raw, timely new play inspired by *Mother Courage and Her Children*.\
\
***The Madres***\
**By Stephanie Allison Walker**\
Buenos Aires, 1979. People are disappearing right off the street during the so-called "Dirty War."

Desperate to find her, they come up with a plan to try to see Belén one last time. If they can. Taut and psychologically nuanced, this political drama shows the strength and resilience of three generations of women in the face of dangerous and unimaginable circumstances.\

***The House on the Hill***\
**By Amy E. Witting**\
Cousins Alex and Frankie haven't spoken in ten years since a single devastating moment shattered their lives and families. After a decade of trauma, can a new birth help them heal at last?
