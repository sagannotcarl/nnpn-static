<p><span class="lead-in">Washington, D.C. - National New Play Network, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that champions the development, production, and continued life of new plays, celebrates the opening of <em>Winter </em>by Julie Jensen on the second leg of its Rolling World Premiere at Rivendell Theatre Ensemble (Chicago, IL, January 16-February 17, 2017). The play ran from October 12-November 13, 2016 at NNPN Core Member Salt Lake Acting Company (UT), and will conclude its Roll at Associate Member Central Works (Berkeley, CA), from July 15-August 20, 2017.</span></p>
<p><em>Winter</em>, which is based on the 1975 short story “Robeck” by Margaret Pabst Battin, looks at one family’s experience with the decline of old age and the right to die. The Salt Lake Acting Company production sparked conversations among audiences and the community at large, as Utah considers its own “End of Life Options Act”.</p>
<p>In her review, Barbara M. Bannon writes for the <em>Salt Lake Tribune</em>, “As the population age and enter the winter of their lives, end-of-life questions become more relevant and controversial. Should people be able to control when and how they die? What are the ethical and religious implications? Winter offers no easy answers, but its audience will leave the theater challenged by the choices.”</p>
<p>Rivendell’s production opened January 16 and runs through February 17. More photos from the production can be viewed on Broadway World.</p>
<p>NNPN provides production support to the playwright and the partnering theaters, including assistance with the creation and the contracting of the premiere agreement, collaborative interactions between the theaters, and funds for the playwright's residency in each city to further develop the play.</p>
<h3>ABOUT WINTER</h3>
<p>She’s a woman of an age, a retired English professor and poet. And she’s on a road she knows too well. She’s in decline, and it’s frightening. Her husband and she have always had a pact to go off together, when the time is right. But he has his work. When her sons come home for Thanksgiving, one of them decides something must be done. But Annis takes her own course, with the help of her free-spirit granddaughter. Inspired by the story “Robeck” by Margaret Pabst Battin.</p>
