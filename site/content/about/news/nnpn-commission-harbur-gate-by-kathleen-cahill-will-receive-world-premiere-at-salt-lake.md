<span class="lead-in">Washington, D.C. - National New Play Network, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that champions the development, production, and continued life of new plays, announces the World Premiere of its 2012-13 Annual Commission, </span>*<span class="lead-in">Harbur</span>*<span class="lead-in">* Gate* by Kathleen Cahill, at Core Member Salt Lake Acting Company (SLAC). The Commission, which was awarded to Ms. Cahill in collaboration with Salt Lake Acting Company, will receive its first professional production from February 8-March 12.</span>

In their joint proposal for the Commission, Cynthia Fleming (Executive Artistic Director of SLAC) and Ms. Cahill noted that the inspiration for the play was “The Veteran in a New Field,” a Civil War-era painting by Winslow Homer: “It presents an image of a figure scything a field of golden wheat, life and death locked in the same moment. The veteran doesn’t look like a soldier and we assume it’s a painting of a man, because veterans are – or rather were – men. But no longer. The veteran in [*Harbur Gate*] is a woman.”

Since its conception, *Harbur Gate* has developed into a play which asks the questions: what does leadership look like? What makes a warrior? Or a hero? And if trust is the bedrock of the soldier’s profession, what happens when that trust is broken? At a time of evolving notions about what it means to be a woman or a man, Harbur Gate explores the military as a gendered space where, as one character puts it, “men are men and women are not.”

<h3>ABOUT *HARBUR GATE*</h3>
Six characters, in three interconnected plays, illuminate the emotional chaos that results from the experience of war: how it can disturb, destroy, and transform the lives of three women forever.

*Harbur Gate* is also the recipient of a 2016 Edgerton Foundation New Play Award, which supports an extended rehearsal process for select world premiere productions. It can be found on the New Play Exchange here.
