<h3>ABOUT <em>BR’ER COTTON</em></h3>
<p>Lynchburg, Virginia. The former site of a thriving cotton mill is now an impoverished neighborhood. Deeply affected by all the recent killings of young black men like himself, Ruffrino, a 14 year old militant, incites riots at school and online. More and more at odds with his mother and grandfather, the boys anger grows beyond containment while the family home literally sinks into the cotton field, and no one seems to notice but him.</p>
<p>Br’er Cotton tackles complicated issues of racism and racial identity through the lens of three generations’ wildly differing attitudes and responses. The play raises difficult questions that have no easy answers and does it in a way that is fiercely theatrical, fresh, and innovative.</p>

Under the artistic and executive leadership of Producing Artistic Director Cynthia Levin, the theatre has produced more than 300 productions, with 20 percent of those being world premieres. “We believe that as theatre artists we should take responsibility for illuminating significant issues and initiating change,” Levin said. “Our hope is that every time you come to the Unicorn, you discover something about yourself you did not know before you walked in.” In the Midtown neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri, Unicorn Theatre houses two intimate stages — The Levin Stage (formerly The Main Stage) and The Jerome Stage (added in 2008). <a href="https://www.unicorntheatre.com/" rel="nofollow">unicorntheatre.org</a></p>
