<blockquote>“From poverty to corruption to misogyny to the power of being female, the play brings to life the extreme difficulty of life in Mexico, and the pride and determination of its citizens…With a touch of magic realism and a hint of madcap adventure, there is humor amid the grim circumstances, and celebration…”

<p align="right">- Meg Currell, <a href="http://www.edgemedianetwork.com/197247" rel="nofollow">Edge Media Network</a>

“*Into the Beautiful North* is a patchwork quilt of cultural references from south to north and back again…though moments seem supernatural, they are rooted in real life.”

“…it manages to take the disheartening raw material and, through the alchemy of inspired satire, turn it into a laugh-filled theatrical experience…. but this Urrea/Zacarías collaboration…has the added merit of never allowing the humor to blind us to the plight of characters who are more than just two-dimensional comic creations.”

“The American theater needs this fast-paced cast, who remind us of Don Quixote’s quest, including characters from varied origins, sexes and ways of living. “

<h3>**ABOUT *INTO THE BEAUTIFUL NORTH***</h3>
All the men of the sleepy Mexican village of Tres Camarones have left town in search of fortune in the USA. Bandidos are threatening to take over the defenseless town. One night, 19 year old Nayeli watches* “*The Magnificent Seven” at the local cinema and has a flash of inspiration. She grabs her goth best friend Vampi and her gay confidant Tacho, and sets out on a quest of epic proportions – to find men in the U.S.A. and smuggle them back across the border to repopulate and protect her beloved town! And so begins a 1,000 mile road trip from the Pacific Coast of Mexico through the colorful streets of Tijuana to the climactic scene at the Bahia Hotel in Mission Bay, San Diego.
