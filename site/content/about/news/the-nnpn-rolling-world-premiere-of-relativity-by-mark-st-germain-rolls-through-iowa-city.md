Highlights from press coverage of Riverside Theatre and Florida Studio Theatre’s productions include:

<blockquote>“The theater’s intimate setting is perfect for this glimpse into the private world of one of the greatest minds the world has known. It’s a play built on “what-ifs” and “if onlys” — those corrosive dramas that unfold in our minds during sleepless nights and can eat away at our souls… It’s a tour de force creation for both actors.”

“There may well be at least one thing, but perhaps a lot, to learn in seeing *Relativity*…a play good for repeat attendance.”

“In only 80 minutes (with no intermission), St. Germain and his cast pack a lot of intellectual and emotional punch.”

“These are weighty issues for an 80-minute play without intermission, but St. Germain builds on them with both seriousness and a good amount of humor to make them relatable…”

<h3>**ABOUT *****RELATIVITY***</h3>
In 1902, Albert Einstein's daughter was born. In 1904 she disappeared and Einstein never spoke nor wrote of her again. What happened? With playfulness and intensity, Relativity imagines one theory that bridges the Einsteins: the beloved public figure to the perplexing private man and the father to the lost child.
