<p>Highlights from press coverage of Riverside Theatre and Florida Studio Theatre’s productions include:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The theater’s intimate setting is perfect for this glimpse into the private world of one of the greatest minds the world has known. It’s a play built on “what-ifs” and “if onlys” — those corrosive dramas that unfold in our minds during sleepless nights and can eat away at our souls… It’s a tour de force creation for both actors.”</p>

<p>“There may well be at least one thing, but perhaps a lot, to learn in seeing <em>Relativity</em>…a play good for repeat attendance.”</p>

<p>“In only 80 minutes (with no intermission), St. Germain and his cast pack a lot of intellectual and emotional punch.”</p>

<p>“These are weighty issues for an 80-minute play without intermission, but St. Germain builds on them with both seriousness and a good amount of humor to make them relatable…”</p>

<p>In 1902, Albert Einstein's daughter was born. In 1904 she disappeared and Einstein never spoke nor wrote of her again. What happened?
