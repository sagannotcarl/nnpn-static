We also hoped the RWP would ignite a national movement, with theaters across the country wanting to produce the play as a vehicle for social action. The response has been overwhelming, far beyond anything we could have imagined.”</span><br /><span> </span><br /><span>Mr. Schenkkan and the Rolling World Premiere partnering theaters have received international attention in </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/theater/trump-wall-mexico-play.html?_r=0" rel="nofollow"><em>The New York Times</em></a><em>,</em><span> </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/02/05/what-do-we-do-in-the-time-of-trump-the-theater-community-is-trying-to-figure-out-the-answer/?utm_term=.e12adf06be85" rel="nofollow"><em>The Washington Post</em></a><span>, and on the </span><a href="http://www.lucypr.com/Projects/Web/Wall_BBC-Newshour.mp3" rel="nofollow"><em>BBC Newshour</em></a><span> for their rapid artistic response to the current administration and the political climate it foments.

<p><strong>ABOUT <em>BUILDING THE WALL</em></strong><br /><span>It’s the very near future, and the Trump administration has carried out his campaign promise to round up and detain millions of immigrants. Now, a writer interviews the supervisor of a private prison as he awaits sentencing for carrying out the federal policy that has escalated into the unimaginable. This riveting, harrowing and illuminating drama delivers a powerful warning and puts a human face on the inhuman, revealing how when personal accountability is denied, what seems inconceivable becomes inevitable.</span></p>
