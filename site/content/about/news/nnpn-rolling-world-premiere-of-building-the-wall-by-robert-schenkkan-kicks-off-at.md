<span>Fountain Theatre has provided extensive insight into the company’s work on their lead production, which started previews last Wednesday, March 15, on their blog “</span><a href="https://intimateexcellent.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Intimate Excellent</a><span>.” Stephen Sachs, Co-Artistic Director, expands further on his choice to produce this Rolling World Premiere in Fountain Theatre’s 2017-18 season: “It was crucial to me to shepherd the play through the NNPN pipeline as a Rolling World Premiere, so Robert could continue developing the script. We also hoped the RWP would ignite a national movement, with theaters across the country wanting to produce the play as a vehicle for social action. The response has been overwhelming, far beyond anything we could have imagined.”</span>\

**ABOUT *BUILDING THE WALL***\
<span>It’s the very near future, and the Trump administration has carried out his campaign promise to round up and detain millions of immigrants. Now, a writer interviews the supervisor of a private prison as he awaits sentencing for carrying out the federal policy that has escalated into the unimaginable. This riveting, harrowing and illuminating drama delivers a powerful warning and puts a human face on the inhuman, revealing how when personal accountability is denied, what seems inconceivable becomes inevitable.</span>
