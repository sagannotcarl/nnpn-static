Acclaim for *Dogs of Rwanda*:

<blockquote>“Lewis delivers the gripping tale of a callow, lovesick young man who only went to Africa to be with his crush and got much, much more than he bargained for.”

“This...show has been leaving a powerful impression on audiences in the few venues lucky to have seen it so far.”

“This play is a fascinating and exhausting hourlong monologue, performed with great power and subtlety by Dan Hodge. The gruesome details and the action-filled chronicle are riveting — an enormous challenge in a solo show…Lewis’ *Dogs of Rwanda* is filled with small motivic links that knit the play together, far more complex effects than I could catch in one viewing.”

On the 20th anniversary of the genocide he witnessed firsthand, a book David wrote regarding his experiences that Spring arrives with a note from the Rwandan boy he once tried to save. “You didn’t tell them everything,” it says. “You didn’t tell them everything.” A dinner party story for the ages.
