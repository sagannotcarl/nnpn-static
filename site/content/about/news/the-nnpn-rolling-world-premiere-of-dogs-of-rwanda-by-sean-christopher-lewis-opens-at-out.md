<p>Acclaim for <em>Dogs of Rwanda</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Lewis delivers the gripping tale of a callow, lovesick young man who only went to Africa to be with his crush and got much, much more than he bargained for.”</p>

<p>“This...show has been leaving a powerful impression on audiences in the few venues lucky to have seen it so far.”</p>

<p>“This play is a fascinating and exhausting hourlong monologue, performed with great power and subtlety by Dan Hodge. The gruesome details and the action-filled chronicle are riveting — an enormous challenge in a solo show…Lewis’ <em>Dogs of Rwanda</em> is filled with small motivic links that knit the play together, far more complex effects than I could catch in one viewing.”</p>
