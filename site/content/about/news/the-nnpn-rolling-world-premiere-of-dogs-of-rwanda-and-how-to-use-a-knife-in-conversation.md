<span class="lead-in">Washington, D.C. - National New Play Network, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that champions the development, production, and continued life of new plays, is supporting two plays that reflect on experiences of the Rwandan genocide through its Rolling World Premieres program. *How to Use a Knife* by Will Snider and *Dogs of Rwanda* by Sean Christopher Lewis each offer a look into the intersections of identity, truth-telling, and accountability through stories that ask what it means to be human in a world of deep and pervasive ethnic conflict.</span>

Two of NNPN’s founding Core Members – Phoenix Theatre in Indianapolis and InterAct Theatre Company in Philadelphia, are presenting this pair of plays in close proximity during the first half of 2017. Phoenix Theatre, who’s production of *Dogs of Rwanda*, closed this Sunday, January 15, will run *How to Use a Knife* from January 19-February 12. InterAct will present the plays in repertory, with a limited number of performances of *Dogs of Rwanda* interspersed throughout its run of *How to Use a Knife* from May 26-June 18.

“You might conclude that we are presenting *Dogs of Rwanda* and *How to Use a Knife* to make a statement about the Rwandan genocide following the civil war in the spring of 1994,” says Bryan Fonseca, Producing Director of Phoenix Theatre. “But you’d be mostly wrong. Both plays do share the impact of that genocide as a backdrop to their unique stories. But both plays have a central character grappling with guilt from personal tragedy and loss. The central character from each play must confront the ghosts of his past in the journey towards salvation. And yes, Rwanda is central to the plot. But these plays are about individuals, and not politics.”

Seth Rozin, Producing Artistic Director of InterAct explains, “We jumped at the opportunity to produce the Rolling World Premieres of *How to Use a Knife* and *Dogs of Rwanda* in a unique kind of repertory arrangement. Our audiences will have the opportunity to see two terrific new plays that share some common subject matter – themes of guilt and redemption, specifically in relation to the Rwandan genocide – told in completely different ways: …*Knife *is a hard-driving, realistic play, with a cast of seven, the story of which is shown to us in straightforward chronological order; *Dogs*… is an intimate, one-man play that is told to us, as it bounces back and forth between past and present. As with all of our productions at InterAct, we will be facilitating talk backs after every performance following the opening night. We expect there to be rich and dynamic conversations about each play, separately, as well as about how the two plays speak to each other.”

Highlighting the urgency and relevance of the themes explored in each play, Mr. Fonseca concludes, “I chose the plays because we (you - the audience) are the central characters in both plays. We are constantly reminded of catastrophic world events and feel powerless to help and yet, we carry the awareness and guilt associated with each new atrocity. Because we are aware and do nothing. Every news report of slaughter reminds us of America’s own treatment of Native and African Americans and it adds to the guilt we carry. We are haunted by our actions or lack thereof. These plays remind us of these events and allow us to accept and forgive ourselves of our inability to act. If the effect of too much violence on TV is a violent society – what is the effect of too much enlightenment?”

The NNPN Rolling World Premiere of *Dogs of Rwanda* started at 16th Street Theater (Berwyn, IL) in November 2016, where it was hailed as “the gripping tale of a callow, lovesick young man who only went to Africa to be with his crush and got much, much more than he bargained for,” (Jack Helbig, Chicago Reader). After its productions at Phoenix and InterAct, it will complete its Roll at Associate Member Out of Hand Theater (Atlanta) this fall.

*How to Use Knife* kicked off its NNPN RWP in Sacramento last September at Associate Member Capital Stage, to great audience and critical acclaim. It continues in Indianapolis and will Roll through Core Member Unicorn Theatre (Kansas City, MO) January 25 – February 19 before finishing up in Philadelphia.

NNPN provides production support to the playwright and the partnering theaters, including assistance with the creation and the contracting of the premiere agreement, collaborative interactions between the theaters, and funds for the playwright's residency in each city to further develop the play.
