<span class="lead-in">**Washington, D.C.** - <a href="http://nnpn.org/" rel="nofollow">**National New Play Network**</a>**, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that champions the development, production, and continued life of new plays, celebrates the opening of **<a href="https://newplayexchange.org/plays/63236/winter" rel="nofollow">***Winter***</a> **by **<a href="https://newplayexchange.org/users/7849/julie-jensen" rel="nofollow">**Julie Jensen**</a>** on the third leg of its Rolling World Premiere at **<a href="http://centralworks.org/winter/" rel="nofollow">**Central Works**</a>** (Berkeley, CA, July 15-August 13, 2017). **The play ran from October 12-November 13, 2016 at NNPN Core Member <a href="http://saltlakeactingcompany.org/this-season/item/1153-winter" rel="nofollow">**Salt Lake Acting Company**</a> (UT) and from January 7-February 11 at Associate Member **<a href="http://rivendelltheatre.org/winter/" rel="nofollow">Rivendell Theatre Ensemble</a> **(Chicago, IL), where it was lauded by both critics and audiences.</span>

The play, which is based on the 1975 short story “Robeck” by Margaret Pabst Battin (published in *Ending Life: Ethics and the Way We Die*, Oxford University Press, 2005), looks at one family’s experience with the decline of old age and the right to die. Chris Jones of the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/reviews/ct-winter-review-ent-0118-20170117-column.html" rel="nofollow">*Chicago Tribune*</a> described the play as “sincere and empathetic,” calling Rivendell Theatre Ensemble’s production “deeply moving.” Central Works’ production will open July 15, with one preview on July 14, and run through August 13.

NNPN provides production support to the playwright and the partnering theaters, including assistance with the creation and the contracting of the premiere agreement, collaborative interactions between the theaters, and funds for the playwright's residency in each city to further develop the play.

<h3>ABOUT *WINTER*</h3>
A beautiful, empowering story about a woman whose once-brilliant mind is now diminishing. Her decline is troubling not only to herself, but to her family, who each have different ideas about what’s right for her. Meanwhile she’s ready to take matters into her own hands. Funny, touching, and very topical, *Winter* is a thought-provoking look at our right to die. Inspired by the story “Robeck” by Margaret Pabst Battin.
