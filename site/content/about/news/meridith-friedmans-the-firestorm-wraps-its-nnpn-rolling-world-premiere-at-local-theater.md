<span class="lead-in">**Washington, D.C.** - **The **<a href="http://nnpn.org/" rel="nofollow">**National New Play Network**</a>**, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that champions the development, production, and continued life of new plays, celebrates the success of the NNPN Rolling World Premiere (RWP) of **<a href="https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1358/firestorm" rel="nofollow">***The Firestorm***</a> **by Meridith** **Friedman.** NNPN Associate Member <a href="http://www.localtheatercompany.org/the-firestorm" rel="nofollow">**Local Theater Company**</a> (Boulder, CO) will offer its production, directed by Pesha Rudnick, at Dairy Arts Center’s Carsen Theater from October 13 – November 13.

<blockquote> “Friedman has written a shrewd exploration of politics, privacy, relationships and truth.”\
Lindsey Wilson, <a href="http://dallas.culturemap.com/news/arts/05-27-15-firestorm-kitchen-dog-theater-review/" rel="nofollow">CultureMap Dallas</a>

“Many points do resonate… in a brave play that dares to talk about issues we too often avoid. Kudos to Friedman and Kitchen Dog for getting this new conversation about race started.”\
Nancy Churnin, <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/arts/columnists/nancy-churnin/20150523-firestorm-at-kitchen-dog-kicks-off-important-conversation-about-race.ece" rel="nofollow">The Dallas Morning News</a>

“…the real strength in Friedman's play, nimbly directed by Drew Martin for Stage Left Theatre, is that she's more interested in exploring why people form alliances — political and personal — and how they do or do not withstand the inevitable realization that loyalty has its limits.”\
Kerry Reid, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/reviews/ct-firestorm-stage-left-review-story.html" rel="nofollow">The Chicago Tribune</a>

“In a time where racial tensions continue to grow with each viral clip or photo that appears, Friedman’s script not only provides an open conversation, but in the final scene as experiences are told and choices are made, she might very well have the answer of how healing can begin for us all.”\
Loy Webb, <a href="http://www.newcitystage.com/2015/11/01/review-the-firestormstage-left-theatre/" rel="nofollow">New City Stage</a>

"... a world-premiere play from the always excellent Stage Left Theatre Company, is thrilling in ways that the very best Chicago theater provides – intimate, thought provoking, and above all else, honest."\
