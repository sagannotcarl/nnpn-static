<h4>**ABOUT BARS AND MEASURES**</h4>
Commissioned by B Street Theatre, *Bars and Measures* is the fascinating tale of two brothers. One a classical pianist. The other a jazz bass player. One a Christian. The other a Muslim. One living in freedom. The other in jail. Separated by bars, the brothers try to reconcile their differences through the language they know best. Music. A beautiful journey through faith, family, melody and time.
