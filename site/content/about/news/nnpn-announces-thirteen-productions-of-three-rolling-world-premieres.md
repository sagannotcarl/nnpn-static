Four women play twenty roles (including all the males roles) in this comedy about Jessica an actress from Minnesota who has been cast to play Hamlet in New York. After accidentally interrupting a production of Hamlet starring Patrick Stewart, not only does Jessica think Mr. Stewart is stalking her, but she also faces an uphill battle through a maze of self-important humanities professors, Freudian psychiatrists and a Minnesota mother, only to discover that she doesn’t understand Hamlet or herself. The search for identity is the theme as Jessica takes on her emotional baggage and existential overload, as well as her self-doubt and disdain for Danish fondue. There is no need for the audience to have seen or even understand Hamlet in order to follow Jessica’s comic search to find her unique self in this fast moving pageant.
