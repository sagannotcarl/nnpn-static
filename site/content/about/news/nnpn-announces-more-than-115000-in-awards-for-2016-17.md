<span class="lead-in">**Washington, D.C.** - National New Play Network, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that champions the development, production, and continued life of new plays, announced its 2016-17 grant recipients, including the 2016 Smith Prize for Political Theatre, four Producer Residencies, and four Collaboration Fund awards that will support partnerships between multiple Member Theaters, playwrights, and other theater makers in various projects.</span>

Executive Director Nan Barnett reported that “The growth of these awards mirrors the expanding impact of the Network as it continues to support the development, production and continued life of new plays and innovate and implement programs that change how American theater is discovered, made and shared.”

NNPN Affiliated Artist <a href="https://newplayexchange.org/users/369/jennifer-barclay" rel="nofollow">**Jennifer Barclay**</a> received the 2016 SMITH PRIZE FOR POLITICAL THEATRE, established in 2006 by Timothy Jay Smith and a group of socially conscious donors to encourage emerging playwrights to tackle the pressing issues of our times. Her project, *Ripe Frenzy*, will examine the role that media plays in perpetuating the mass shootings in the US. Set in a small fictional town, the play will be told in part through some of the oldest storytelling approaches – a Greek chorus, and stories shared around a campfire – and in part through contemporary media techniques. For the latter, Jennifer has teamed up with Jared Mezzocchi, an award-winning projections designer. Barclay is a Chicago-bred actor-turned-playwright who recently relocated to Washington D.C. to join the faculty at the University of Maryland. She previously developed work with NNPN at the 2009 MFA Playwrights Workshop, in conjunction with the Kennedy Center.

In 2016-17, four emerging theater makers will serve as PRODUCERS IN RESIDENCE at NNPN’s Core Members: **Cat Ramirez** at <a href="http://www.interacttheatre.org/" rel="nofollow">**InterAct Theatre Company**</a> (Philadelphia, PA), **Maria** **Patrice Amon** at <a href="http://www.sdrep.org/" rel="nofollow">**San Diego REPertory Theatre**</a> (CA), **Helen Jaksch** at <a href="http://www.southernrep.com/" rel="nofollow">**Southern Rep Theatre**</a> (New Orleans, LA), and <a href="https://newplayexchange.org/users/872/olivia-haller" rel="nofollow">**Olivia Haller**</a> at <a href="http://www.woollymammoth.net/" rel="nofollow">**Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company**</a> (Washington, DC). The program aims to revolutionize the way theaters support new plays by educating new leaders about collaboration, training early-career producers about successful models, and providing connections to alternative networks.

The COLLABORATION FUND was established in an effort to encourage innovative, pioneering, project-based partnerships among theaters in support of playwrights and new plays. Monies are awarded annually on a competitive basis to projects proposed by National New Play Network Core Members, working together with other Member Theaters and playwrights on the development or production of a new work or works. NNPN is grateful that for 2016-17 additional monies for this program were provided by the Tides Foundation’s Venturous Theater Fund, in recognition of NNPN’s expansion of this program to include Theater to Playwright Collaborations. This new configuration is the Network’s effort to address the many different ways theater companies work together and with playwrights to develop and produce new works. This year, NNPN will support four collaborative projects.

<a href="http://www.borderlandstheater.org/" rel="nofollow">**Borderlands Theater**</a> (Tucson, AZ) will develop playwright <a href="http://www.virginiagrise.com/" rel="nofollow">**Virginia Grise**</a>’s adaptation of the Helena Maria Viramontes’ novel, *Their Dogs Came With Them*, for which Grise was awarded the 2015 NNPN Annual Commission. “The collaboration consists of site specific developmental readings to create time and space for Viramontes and Grise to work closely on the adaptation; to arrive at a production ready script for the 2017-2018 season; and to share the script with targeted communities (homeless teens, women who are incarcerated, and young people of color) who are particularly impacted by the issues discussed in the play,” according to Borderlands Producing Artistic Director, Marc Pinate.

<a href="http://magictheatre.org/" rel="nofollow">**Magic Theatre**</a> (San Francisco, CA) and NNPN Affiliated Artist <a href="http://www.mfonisoudofia.com/" rel="nofollow">**Mfoniso Udofia**</a> (alumni of the National Showcase of New Plays) will partner a ten-day developmental residency, culminating in a concert reading of Udofia's complete nine-play *Ufot Family Cycle*. From Loretta Grecco, Artistic Director: "We believe that this super-sized undertaking will afford Mfoniso not only an invaluable opportunity to hear the cycle performed together but also vital opportunities to secure new artistic homes across the country. This process of building national investment in a writer is time-consuming; we hope to jump start that process and give Mfoniso best possible odds for artistic success and financial sustainability, so that she may remain in the field for a long time. To accomplish this goal, we will invite more than a dozen national new play leaders, representing theatres on both coasts and a handful of adventurous organizations in between, to attend the reading series and host them in San Francisco if they accept.”

<a href="http://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/new-play-development/slac-playwrights-lab" rel="nofollow">**Salt Lake Acting Company**</a> (UT) is using NNPN support to augment its <a href="http://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/new-play-development/slac-playwrights-lab" rel="nofollow">**Playwrights’ Lab**</a>, “a week-long developmental play laboratory that brings together some of the most talented, generous, and fearless new play warriors in the country to delve into the work of four trailblazing playwrights,” in the words of Cynthia Fleming and Shannon Musgrave, Executive and Associate Artistic Directors, respectively. In its third iteration, the Lab will work with at least one NNPN Affiliated Artist and bring in at least five more Member Theater representatives to participate in the process as directors, dramaturgs, and other resource artists.

<a href="https://newplayexchange.org/users/631/amanda-jane-shank" rel="nofollow">**Amanda Jane Shank**</a> (2011 MFA Playwrights Workshop alumni) will complete a season-long Residency at <a href="http://www.unicorntheatre.org/" rel="nofollow">**Unicorn Theatre**</a> (Kansas City, MO), the first of its kind for this Core Member Theater. In addition to providing space for Shank to work on two new scripts, the playwright will also participate in dramaturgy, the In-Progress New Play Reading Series, and involvement on a number of Unicorn’s artistic programs. From Shank, a native of Kansas City, “I feel the Unicorn is the ideal home for me to develop my work at this time...because my work is fundamentally, soulfully, and inextricably informed by my experience of growing up in Kansas City in a way that begs to be torn wide open. It is because the Kansas City community provided me with my first crucial theatrical opportunities and I am finally at the point in my career that I can begin to create opportunities in return. It is because the Unicorn is a theater that has long been helmed by a female artistic director and, as an emerging playwright committed to creating work that transforms the representation of women on stage, that particular quality of mentorship is absolutely crucial to me.”

**ABOUT THE SMITH PRIZE FOR POLITICAL THEATRE**

The $5,000 Prize is awarded annually as a commission, chosen by the Network, from proposals from NNPN-affiliated early career writers for a play that examines the American body politic. NNPN also compensates a Core Member theater up to $2,500 for a developmental workshop of the play, and provides an additional $2,500 to the first NNPN Core Member to fully produce the resulting work.
