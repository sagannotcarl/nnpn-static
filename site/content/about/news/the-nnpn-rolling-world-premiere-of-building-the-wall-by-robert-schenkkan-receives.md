<p><span class="lead-in"><strong>Washington, D.C. - </strong><a href="http://nnpn.org/" rel="nofollow"><strong>National New Play Network</strong></a><strong>, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that champions the development, production, and continued life of new plays, celebrates the initial success of the Rolling World Premiere of </strong><a href="http://www.buildingthewallplay.com/" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>Building the Wall</em></strong></a><strong> by Robert Schenkkan as Curious Theatre Company prepares to open its production on April 4.</strong> The latest play from the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning playwright is on a Roll, with the support of Paul Prokop, through Core Members <a href="http://www.fountaintheatre.com/event/building-the-wall/" rel="nofollow">Fountain Theatre</a> (Los Angeles, CA; March 18-May 21, 2017), <a href="http://curioustheatre.org/building-the-wall/" rel="nofollow">Curious Theatre Company</a> (Denver, CO; April 4-19, 2017), and <a href="http://www.borderlandstheater.org/" rel="nofollow">Borderlands Theater</a> (Tucson, AZ; September 27-October 15), as well as Associate Members <a href="https://forum-theatre.org/" rel="nofollow">Forum Theatre</a> (Washington, DC; April 27-May 27, 2017) and <a href="http://www.citytheatre.com/" rel="nofollow">City Theatre</a> (Miami, FL; September 20-October 8, 2017).</span></p>
<p>Highlights from press coverage of Fountain Theatre’s production include:</p>
<blockquote><p>“’Building the Wall’ should be seen and shuddered over, if only to heighten our collective vigilance. The theater historically has provided a forum for citizens to contemplate the agonizing issues of the day, and it’s heartening to see Schenkkan and the Fountain respond with such celerity to present dangers.”</p>

<p>“A Trump supporter might watch <em>Building the Wall</em> and see a case of liberal hysteria from a coastal snowflake, forecasting doom and gloom just because his candidate didn’t win…But although it simmers with of-the-moment urgency, it logically illustrates, step by step, how fascism can gradually take root among people who abhor it.”</p>

<p>“It’s not necessary to accept that Nazi-like death camps are right around the corner. The point is to consider what small roles faceless, nameless people are performing every day that construct a mass mentality of indifference to suffering. That is the “wall” in this play, not so much a physical structure along the Mexican border, but an impermeable barrier between human beings that blocks all empathy...See it while you can.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In an NNPN <a href="http://nnpn.org/programs/rolling-world-premieres" rel="nofollow">Rolling World Premiere</a>, the Network provides production support to the playwright and the partnering theaters, including assistance with the creation and the contracting of the premiere agreement, collaborative interactions between the theaters, and travel and housing funds for the playwright to further develop the play in each city.</p>
<h3>ABOUT <em>BUILDING THE WALL</em></h3>
<p>It’s the very near future, and the Trump administration has carried out his campaign promise to round up and detain millions of immigrants. Now, a writer interviews the supervisor of a private prison as he awaits sentencing for carrying out the federal policy that has escalated into the unimaginable. This riveting, harrowing and illuminating drama delivers a powerful warning and puts a human face on the inhuman, revealing how when personal accountability is denied, what seems inconceivable becomes inevitable.</p>
