Highlights from press coverage of Fountain Theatre’s production include:

<blockquote>“’Building the Wall’ should be seen and shuddered over, if only to heighten our collective vigilance. The theater historically has provided a forum for citizens to contemplate the agonizing issues of the day, and it’s heartening to see Schenkkan and the Fountain respond with such celerity to present dangers.”

“A Trump supporter might watch *Building the Wall* and see a case of liberal hysteria from a coastal snowflake, forecasting doom and gloom just because his candidate didn’t win…But although it simmers with of-the-moment urgency, it logically illustrates, step by step, how fascism can gradually take root among people who abhor it.”

“It’s not necessary to accept that Nazi-like death camps are right around the corner. The point is to consider what small roles faceless, nameless people are performing every day that construct a mass mentality of indifference to suffering. That is the “wall” in this play, not so much a physical structure along the Mexican border, but an impermeable barrier between human beings that blocks all empathy...See it while you can.”

<h3>ABOUT *BUILDING THE WALL*</h3>
It’s the very near future, and the Trump administration has carried out his campaign promise to round up and detain millions of immigrants. Now, a writer interviews the supervisor of a private prison as he awaits sentencing for carrying out the federal policy that has escalated into the unimaginable. This riveting, harrowing and illuminating drama delivers a powerful warning and puts a human face on the inhuman, revealing how when personal accountability is denied, what seems inconceivable becomes inevitable.
