<h4>ABOUT WINTER</h4>
<p>She’s a woman of an age, a retired English professor, and poet. And she’s on a road she knows too well. She’s in decline, and it’s frightening. Her husband and she have always had a pact to go off together when the time is right. But he has his work. When her sons come home for Thanksgiving, one of them decides something must be done. But Annis takes her own course, with the help of her free-spirit granddaughter. Inspired by the story “Robeck” by Margaret Pabst Battin.</p>
