<p><strong>ABOUT <em>BLACKBERRY WINTER</em></strong></p>
<p>Years of success, meticulous planning, and an eye for detail have in no way prepared Vivienne Avery for her mother's slide into the grip of dementia. Initially hiding behind insomnia-fueled baking and a polite smile, stories about her mother leave Vivienne's inner turmoil quietly laid bare in a juxtaposition of stories, theatrical gestures, and a childlike Alzheimer's "creation myth."</p>
<p>The play has received great critical and audience acclaim as it has rolled across the country. </p>
<p>“…intelligent, nuanced and shot through with irony…”</p>

<p>“…a reflection of the gradual process one endures in the midst of a tragedy…carefully-textured… (t)his sensitively evoked piece is ultimately life-affirming…”</p>

<p>“Yockey has devised a delightful way to engage us: Vivienne's creation myth…(t)he poetry of the myth lifts the play to another level.”</p>

<p>“Yockey explores the psychological underpinnings of those affected by relatives or close friends who are ill; and it is Ms. Cook’s brilliance as an actor that hypnotizes and carries us along.”</p>
