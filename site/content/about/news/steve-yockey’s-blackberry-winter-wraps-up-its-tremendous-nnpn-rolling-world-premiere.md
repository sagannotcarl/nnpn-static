**ABOUT *BLACKBERRY WINTER***

Years of success, meticulous planning, and an eye for detail have in no way prepared Vivienne Avery for her mother's slide into the grip of dementia. Initially hiding behind insomnia-fueled baking and a polite smile, stories about her mother leave Vivienne's inner turmoil quietly laid bare in a juxtaposition of stories, theatrical gestures, and a childlike Alzheimer's "creation myth."

The play has received great critical and audience acclaim as it has rolled across the country. 

“…intelligent, nuanced and shot through with irony…”

“…a reflection of the gradual process one endures in the midst of a tragedy…carefully-textured… (t)his sensitively evoked piece is ultimately life-affirming…”

“Yockey has devised a delightful way to engage us: Vivienne's creation myth…(t)he poetry of the myth lifts the play to another level.”

“Yockey explores the psychological underpinnings of those affected by relatives or close friends who are ill; and it is Ms. Cook’s brilliance as an actor that hypnotizes and carries us along.”

“Check this one out, because it’s really rather special.”
