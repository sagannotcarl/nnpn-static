<p><span class="lead-in">Washington, D.C. - <a href="http://nnpn.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>National New Play Network</strong></a><strong>, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that champions the development, production, and continued life of new plays,</strong> announces its 2017-18 grant recipients, including the 2017 Smith Prize for Political Theatre, seven Producer Residencies, and five Collaboration Fund awards that will support partnerships between multiple Member Theaters, playwrights, and other theater makers in various projects.</span></p>
<p>From Executive Director Nan Barnett: "We are pleased that these Residencies, Commissions, and awards in support of Collaborations between NNPN’s Member Theaters and these artists and theater-makers will impact 15 communities this year.  But, of course, the new play field and its audiences will reap the benefits of these programs around the world for years to come."</p>
<h3><strong>SMITH PRIZE</strong></h3>
<p>NNPN Affiliated Artist <a href="https://newplayexchange.org/users/1419/jacqueline-goldfinger" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Jacqueline Goldfinger</strong></a> received the 12th <a href="http://nnpn.org/programs/commissions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Smith Prize for Political Theater</strong></a>, established in 2006 by Timothy Jay Smith and a group of socially conscious donors to encourage emerging playwrights to tackle the pressing issues of our times.<br /><br />Her project, <em><strong>Babel</strong></em>, takes on issues of privacy and genetic testing, and how such testing could be used to discriminate in terms of things like jobs, education, and social status. In this version of a near future society, prospective parents learn within the first month of conception what traits their child will have and what behaviors it is likely to exhibit. Based on these test results, they are either issued a PRE certification which legally guarantees the baby will be a "good" person or not. Without the certification, the child will be limited in what it is allowed to do. Two couples, both early in their pregnancies, collide over whether or not to open the PRE certification test results, and what to do once they know the results. <br /><br />Core Member <a href="https://www.floridastudiotheatre.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Florida Studio Theatre</a>, which nominated the Philadelphia-based playwright for this prize, was first introduced to Goldfinger and her work at the 2015 National Showcase of New Plays, where her new play <em>The Arsonists</em> was presented.<em>The Arsonists</em> is currently receiving an NNPN Rolling World Premiere at Associate Members <a href="http://www.azukatheatre.org/the-arsonists/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Azuka Theatre</a> (Philadelphia), <a href="https://knowtheatre.com/season-20/the-arsonists/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Know Theatre of Cincinnati</a>, <a href="http://capstage.org/box-office/subscriptions/2017-18-season-future-tense/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Capital Stage</a> (Sacramento), and Core Member <a href="http://www.ptalaska.org/season39/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perseverance Theatre</a> (Juneau/Anchorage).</p>
