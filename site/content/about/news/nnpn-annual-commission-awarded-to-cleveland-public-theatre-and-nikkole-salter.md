<span class="lead-in">Washington, D.C. - The National New Play Network, the country's alliance of nonprofit theaters that champions the development, production, and continued life of new plays, announces the 2016-17 Annual Commission is awarded to Core Member Cleveland Public Theatre (OH) and playwright Nikkole Salter. The supported project is, as yet, untitled and will concern the consent decree created in May 2015 between Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, the Cleveland Division of Police, and the U.S. Department of Justice. This agreement, designed to address the excessive use of force of Cleveland’s police, is one city's response to an issue that pervades many metropolitan areas across the country.</span>

In what will be the third collaboration between Ms. Salter and Cleveland Public Theatre, the play will explore the dense layers of human experience that form the context and inform the response to the issue of Cleveland's historically strained relationship between the police force and the citizenry. Says Cleveland Public Theatre Artistic Director Raymond Bobgan, “In this moment of transformation for our city and our country, we are eager to see what Nikkole creates. Her voice is both bold and subtle, laying out powerful truths and then layering in unexpected discoveries as her work unfolds. She guides audiences down the path of self- and social critique until even long-held beliefs and biases begin unraveling.”

<h3>ABOUT THE NNPN ANNUAL COMMISSION</h3>
The National New Play Network Annual Commission is chosen from projects nominated by Core Members and selected by NNPN’s Board of Directors. NNPN awards at least one $10,000 commission each year, and the theater that nominated the winning proposal is responsible for the administration and development of the commissioned play. Commissioned playwrights agree to grant the right of first refusal to produce their play to all NNPN Core Members in their respective markets, and pay royalties to the Network only after reaching a predetermined level of income from the play.
