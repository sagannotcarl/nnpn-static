**ABOUT *THE GHOSTS OF LOTE BRAVO***

In Juárez, Mexico, the most violent city in the world, Juanda’s daughter goes missing from the sweatshop they work in. When the crooked policia refuse to help, Juanda's only hope is to ask the dark saint, La Santa Muerte, to guide her. Charging through dreams and visions, Juanda must risk everything if she ever hopes to see her daughter again in this riveting production.

Bettis first developed *The* *Ghosts of Lote Bravo* at Juilliard PlayLab and the 2014 <a href="http://nnpn.org/programs/mfa-playwrights%E2%80%99-workshop" rel="nofollow">MFA Playwrights’ Workshop</a>, hosted each summer by the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival and NNPN.

**ABOUT UNICORN THEATRE**

Founded in 1974, <a href="http://unicorntheatre.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unicorn Theatre</a> enhances Kansas City by developing and producing professional, provocative new plays. Unicorn Theatre chooses new plays, most of which are less than five years old, that have never been performed in Kansas City, or often anywhere in our Midwest region or anywhere at all. We look for plays about strong female characters, people of color, LGBT, and any marginalized group. We believe that as theatre artists we should take responsibility for illuminating significant issues and initiating change. Our hope is that every time you come to the Unicorn, you discover something about yourself you did not know before you walked in. Unicorn Theatre is under the artistic and executive leadership of Producing Artistic Director Cynthia Levin, who joined the company in 1979. We have produced more than 300 productions, with 20 percent of those being world premieres. From our home in the Midtown neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri, the Unicorn houses two intimate stages —The Levin Stage (formerly The Main Stage) and The Jerome Stage (added in 2008).
