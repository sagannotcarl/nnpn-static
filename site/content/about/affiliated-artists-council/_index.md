<span class="lead-in">National New Play Networkâ€™s Affiliated Artists Council is comprised of alumni of its varied programs who wish to serve as advisors to the board and staff of NNPN on matters that affect playwrights, directors, and producers.</span>

Led by the Affiliated Artist Board Representative, this group meets quarterly via conference call to discuss ideas for current and future programs and alumni interactions.
