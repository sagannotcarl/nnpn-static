NNPN boasts a diverse roster of Member Theaters through its two-tiered membership structure: **Core Members**, the governing network of theaters with annual budgets over $150,000 and missions that affirm a dedication to new works; and **Associate Members**, companies that produce or develop at least one new work per year and demonstrate a commitment to NNPN’s values.

NNPN is agile at its core and broad in its reach. As a robust collection of theaters working together across the nation, NNPN champions the indispensable nature of collaboration between theaters and theater-makers, and the vitality and cultural importance of new plays and living playwrights.

Over the past twenty years, NNPN has provided **millions of dollars in funding to its Member Theaters**, supported **hundreds of productions nationwide** through its innovative programming, helped **launch and sustain the careers of thousands of artists**, and reached hundreds of thousands of audience members around the world with plays that were created and honed with support from NNPN and its diverse consortium of theaters and artists.
