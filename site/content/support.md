NNPN is changing the way the theater is created, made, and shared in America.

NNPN Rolling World Premieres, Producer/Director Residencies, Commissions, the Collaboration Fund, the MFA Playwrights Workshop, the National Showcase of New Plays, and the New Play Exchange each have an astounding impact on the American canon of dramatic literature. Won’t you join us as we support the development, production, and continued life of new works through the organizations and artists who make new plays possible?

Since its founding in 1998, NNPN has supported hundreds of plays, providing employment for thousands of artists across the country through NNPN’s 110 Member Theaters and countless hours of theater for audience members around the world. These funds come from our generous supporters - foundations, public institutions, and individuals - who understand the importance of the support that the Network provides to our Member Theaters, Affiliated Artists - and through the development of plays and playwrights - to theater-goers around the globe.

Help us create a healthy environment for new plays and playwrights, artists, and audiences.
