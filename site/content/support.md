NNPN is changing the way the theater is created, made, and shared in America.

NNPN Rolling World Premieres, Producer and Director Residencies, Playwright Commissions, the Collaboration Fund, the MFA Playwrights Workshop, the National Showcase of New Plays, and the New Play Exchange have each had an astounding impact on the American canon of dramatic literature.  These programs are funded by generous supporters - foundations, public institutions, and individuals - who understand the impact that the Network has on our Member Theaters, Affiliated Artists - and through the development of plays and playwrights - theater-goers around the globe.

Help us create a robust, equitable ecology for new plays and a supportive, vital world for artists and audiences alike.
